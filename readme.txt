@About
Mobile Android geolocation and marketing application for one semu-prepared food brand.

User problems which I try to solve:
1) Find nearest retail store in Kyiv [and route to it]*
2) Find full information about brand's products (ingredients) [and current prices]
3) [Create Pexeso (Memory) game]

*[] - second priority tasks

@TODO
+- Connect to Google Maps, Yandex maps. 
	+= Generate keys for Google/Yandex maps API
- Add retail stores to SQLite DB
- Show retail stores on map
