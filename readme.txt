@About
Mobile Android geolocation and marketing application for one semu-prepared food brand.

User problems which I try to solve:
+1) Find nearest retail store in Kyiv 
+	! 1.1) Build route to it by default application
	1.2) Show more info about store in balloon object
2) Find full information about brand's products (ingredients) [and current prices]
	Examples: 
		http://www.dv.mk.ua/market-prop/
		http://myasolyub.com.ua/catalog/napivfafricat#prettyPhoto 
3) [Create Pexeso (Memory) game]

*[] - second priority tasks

@TODO
+- Connect to Google Maps, Yandex maps. 
	+= Generate keys for Google/Yandex maps API
- Add retail stores to SQLite DB
+- Show retail stores on map
