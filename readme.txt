Mobile Android geolocation and marketing application for one semu-prepared food brand.

User problems which I try to solve:
+1) Find nearest retail store in Kyiv 
	+1.1) Build route to it by default application
	!1.2) Add all retail network info to DB
	1.3) Show more info about retail store store in balloon object
2) Find full information about brand's products (ingredients) [and current prices]
	Examples: 
		http://www.dv.mk.ua/market-prop/

3) [Create Pexeso (Memory) game]
